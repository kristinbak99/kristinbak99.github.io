								Hi there! I'm an Astronomy Ph.D. candidate at

									lies in the study of extreme galaxies and how they evolve. 
									My dissertation, under the advisorship of Dr. John Salzer, 
									centers using the Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) 
									Survey to find and to study Green Pea galaxies, known to be 
									a class of extreme star-forming galaxies.

								<b>Star Formation Acorss Cosmic Time (SFACT) Survey</b><br>
								The Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) survey is a 
								narrowband (NB) imaging survey searching galaxies in the universe with. 
								SFACT utilizes three custom NB filters to find optical line emission in 
								galaxies that is produced via star formation or the accretion of material 
								onto a central supermassive blackhole. SFACT detects these so-called 
								emission-line galaxies (ELGs) when one or more emission lines produced 
								by the ELGs is redshifted into one of our filters and causes excess emission. 
								SFACT detects ELGs in discrete redshift intervals out to z ~ 1. SFACT 
								achieves a median depth of r ~ 22.5 with the faintest detections reaching 
								r ~ 25.8. In addition to NB and ODI gri imaging, all SFACT ELG candidates 
								have spectroscopic follow-up using the Hydra mutli-fiber positioner on the 
								WIYN 3.5m.  I have been an active collaborator on the SFACT survey since 
								Spring 2022 where my role includes participating in the data collection, 
								processing imaging data, and developing new analysis codes for the SFACT 
								data processing pipeline.<br>
